If not changing the contract you will see the example is using Gnosis: 

Open MetaMask and select “Custom RPC” from the Network Dropdown.

In the Custom RPC Settings, add in the Gnosis network details and click Save:

Network Name: Gnosis Chain
New RPC URL: https://rpc.gnosischain.com
Chain ID: 100
Symbol: XDAI
Block Explorer URL: https://gnosisscan.io

After these steps, MetaMask should be able to interact with contracts deployed on the Gnosis Chain. 
If you’re still encountering issues, it might be helpful to check the contract address and ensure 
it’s correct and deployed on the Gnosis Chain. Also, make sure that the ABI (Application Binary 
Interface) used in your code matches the version of the contract deployed on the network.
